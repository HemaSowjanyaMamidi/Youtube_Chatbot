# Youtube_Chatbot

This repository contains a conversational chatbot designed to interact with a given YouTube URL. The chatbot leverages the Gemma model from Groq API and the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from Hugging Face for embedding-based responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Groq API:**
   - Go to the [Groq API Keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) page.
   - Create an API key and store it securely.

2. **Hugging Face API:**
   - Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
   - Go to Profile Settings and create an access token.
   - Save the token in a file named `.env` with the following content:
   - HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=<your_hugging_face_api_key>
   - Ensure that the .env file is present in the root directory of the project to allow the application to access the necessary API keys.
